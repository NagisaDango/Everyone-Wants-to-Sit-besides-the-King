# “Everyone Wants To Sit Besides The Emperor”

Group 17: Yilin Pan, Shengjie Zhang, Jichao Huang, Yiran Luo, Allan Tsai

## Amount of Players:

5 - 7 players

## Identity Cards: (x21)

Emperor x 1，Loyalist x 10 and Rebel x 10 

In every game, there will be one Emperor, and the rest of the player will be either Rebel or Loyalist. At the beginning of the game, each player will get 1 Loyalist card and 1 Rebel card, keep them, then take out the cards that match the player amount according to below and shuffle them together: 

5 players: 1 Emperor card + 2 Rebel cards + 2 Loyalist cards 

6 players: 1 Emperor card + 3 Rebel cards + 2 Loyalist cards 

7 players: 1 Emperor card + 3 Rebel cards + 3 Loyalist cards 

After gathering the identity cards needed, shuffle them together and each player draws one from them. The players then need to look at the identity cards themselves to confirm their own identity, the identity that takes the larger portion in the 3 cards determines the identity of that player. Whoever gets the Emperor card will be the Emperor and needs to reveal their Emperor identity card. The other players keep their identity cards folded, face down on the table and cannot shuffle unless they use an action or ability card that permits them to do so.

## Basic Rules:

Players sit in a circle together before the game starts. 

__Every round in the game follows the sequence:__
1. The Emperor decides the direction of play, either clockwise or counterclockwise, and starts the round with the player next to the Emperor of the direction chosen. 
2. Each player takes action in their turn. 
3. Every round ends with the turn of the Emperor and goes back to 1. above.

__Every player should do these things in their turn:__
1. Drawing Phase: Draw 1 card. 
2. Playing Phase: Choose one of the following to do: 
	1. Action: Play a card. 
	2. Investigate: Check one of the other playerʼs identity cards by yourself. 
	3. Shuffle: Shuffle your identity cards, and discard your cards until you only have one card in your hand. 
	4. Pass: Do nothing. 
3. Discarding Phase: Discard cards you do not want if your cards exceed 2 until you only have 2 cards in your hand. 

__When the ability card deck is not enough:__

Shuffle all the casted and discarded cards back to the deck

## Cards:

__Special Ability Cards__:（x 31）

8 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 

The cards listed as “Instinct Card” can be cast at any time of the game, the other cards can only be casted  during the playerʼs turn. 

__1. Transposition x 8__ 

(Exchange positions with the player on their left or right side. Continue the round with the next player in the playing direction based on the casterʼs current position.) 

For example, player 1 uses the transposition in their turn, and wants to switch position with player 2.

After the transposition, player one is now at whereplayer 2 was, and player 2 is at where player 1 was

Since the round is going counterclockwise when player 1ʼs turn ends, the next player counterclockwise is player 3, so itʼs now player 3ʼs turn and player 2 is skipped. This is a great strategy to use to gain yourselfsome advantage!

__2. Condemn x 5__

(Kill any player at the end of the casterʼs next turn if attack is not blocked, if the casterʼs turn is skipped, the kill will be postponed)
