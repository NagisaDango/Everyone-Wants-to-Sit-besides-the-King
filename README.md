# “Everyone Wants To Sit Besides The Emperor”

Group 17: Yilin Pan, Shengjie Zhang, Jichao Huang, Yiran Luo, Allan Tsai

## Amount of Players:

5 - 7 players

## Identity Cards (x21)

Emperor x 1，Loyalist x 
10 and Rebel x 10 
In every game, there will be one Emperor, and the rest 
of the player will be either Rebel or Loyalist. At the 
beginning of the game, each player will get 1 Loyalist 
card and 1 Rebel card, keep them, then take out the 
cards that match the player amount according to below 
and shuffle them together: 
5 players: 1 Emperor card + 2 Rebel cards + 2 Loyalist cards 
6 players: 1 Emperor card + 3 Rebel cards + 2 Loyalist cards 
7 players: 1 Emperor card + 3 Rebel cards + 3 Loyalist cards 
After gathering the identity cards needed, shuffle them 
together and each player draws one from them. The 
players then need to look at the identity cards 
themselves to confirm their own identity, the identity 
that takes the larger portion in the 3 cards determines 
the identity of that player. Whoever gets the Emperor 
card will be the Emperor and needs to reveal their 
Emperor identity card. The other players keep their 
identity cards folded, face down on the table and 
cannot shuffle unless they use an action or ability card 
that permits them to do so.
